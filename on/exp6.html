<h1>Experiences with Numerics on OpenBSD - 6 - Memory Models</h1>

<p>This is a hard one.</p>

<p>Adjusting the code for the cosmic initializer turned out to be pretty simple, but
when compiled it resulted in a link time error:</p>

<pre><code>ld: error: (....) relocation R_X86_64_PC32 out of range: (...) is not in [-2147483648, 2147483647]
</code></pre>

<h3>-mcmodel=medium</h3>

<p>Asking @misc resulted in the guidance that compiling with
<code>-mcmodel=medium</code> is required. What does this mean?  After
some research, it turns out:</p>

<ul>
<li>some object files are created assuming data and code is within 31-bit offsets
from each other. That is, plus or minus 2GB: [-2147483648, 2147483647].</li>
<li>some object files are created assuming data (not code) is within a 64-bit
offset</li>
<li>the difference is <code>-mcmodel=small</code> for the 2GB data+code model,
and <code>-mcmodel=medium</code> for the 2GB code and 64-bit data model.</li>
</ul>


<p>OK, so rebuild with -mcmodel=medium and the link step works but the
program fails at runtime with:</p>

<pre><code>Program received signal SIGSEGV: Segmentation fault - invalid memory reference.
</code></pre>

<p>The backtrace was 64 calls deep, and meaningless:</p>

<pre><code>(gdb) bt
#0  0x00000b2e7c782d60 in ?? ()
#1  0x0000000000000004 in ?? ()
#2  0x00000b31188a09e0 in ?? ()
#3  0x0000000000000020 in ?? ()
#4  0x0000000000000020 in ?? ()
#5  0x0000000000000001 in ?? ()
#6  0x2b485153b410927a in ?? ()
.... and so on
</code></pre>

<p>But when I ran similar (much smaller) test code, it worked.</p>

<p>So I went back to the failing code.  Digging deeper into the
backtrace required a static build to get a symbol table for the backtrace.
And it was deep into the internals
of fftw3.  Hmm, nothing wrong with that code (by assumption).  Here is
what it looked like:</p>

<pre><code>(gdb) bt
#0  0x00000efe25ec2f80 in recur () from /usr/local/lib/libfftw3f.so.7.1
#1  0x00000efe25ec2e8e in recur () from /usr/local/lib/libfftw3f.so.7.1
#2  0x00000efe25ec365a in zero () from /usr/local/lib/libfftw3f.so.7.1
#3  0x00000efe25e80dc4 in fftwf_measure_execution_time ()
   from /usr/local/lib/libfftw3f.so.7.1
#4  0x00000efe25e7cd2b in evaluate_plan () from /usr/local/lib/libfftw3f.so.7.1
#5  0x00000efe25e7cb47 in search0 () from /usr/local/lib/libfftw3f.so.7.1
#6  0x00000efe25e7b5f3 in mkplan () from /usr/local/lib/libfftw3f.so.7.1
.... and so on
</code></pre>

<p>And this was 25 calls deep.  Not the same issue.  Or, perhaps it was.</p>

<p>Where was I? Linking works, but while running code the program segfaults.  Some kind
of pointer issue, perhaps?  The Fortran code I was testing had no pointers.</p>

<h3>Static sections</h3>

<p>It is very easy to make arrays larger than 2GB. But, in fact what the
initializer was doing was calling <code>pencil_fft.f90</code> which had local
temporary arrays which were only 14M elements, or 56MB.</p>

<p>In Fortran, all statically defined variables end up in the same
section.  A &ldquo;section&rdquo; is a unit of memory allocation as defined by the
linker and loader: it has a name, length, read/write attributes, etc.
All object files are combined by the linker by matching up
their sections and either
concatenating them (such as for static variables or executable code
) or merging them (offset tables).</p>

<p>Programmers don&rsquo;t need to know much about sections until they run into
security issues (write XOR with execute, abbreviated  W ^ X), or
stack size issues, or as in this case, memory addressing issues.</p>

<p>The section here is the .bss section:</p>

<pre><code>$ objdump -h pencil_fft.o

pencil_fft.o:     file format elf64-x86-64

Sections:
Idx Name          Size      VMA               LMA               File off  Algn
  0 .text         00002dd8  0000000000000000  0000000000000000  00000040  2**2
          CONTENTS, ALLOC, LOAD, RELOC, READONLY, CODE
  1 .data         00000000  0000000000000000  0000000000000000  00002e18  2**2
          CONTENTS, ALLOC, LOAD, DATA
  2 .bss          000b4ca8  0000000000000000  0000000000000000  00002e20  2**5
          ALLOC
</code></pre>

<p>where the 0x000b4ca8 size is 740520 bytes (decimal).</p>

<p>Looking into the whole program, the bss section was not too big.  So, back
to examine the code.</p>

<p>The fft routines declared input and output arrays as <code>integer(C_INT), dimension(*), intent(in)</code>
while the calling code was explicit dimensions <code>dimension(number)</code>.  Maybe that
was it?</p>

<h3>Arrays with assumed-shape and explicit-shape</h3>

<p>The difference is whether the calling sequence delivers the array itself
(as with explicit-shape), or some description of it (assumed-shape).  Both
the routine and the main code must agree otherwise you get dreaded
Segmentation faults.</p>

<p>For example</p>

<pre><code>$ cat &gt;t.f90 &lt;&lt; __end
program lbug
  implicit none
  save
  real    r3(ng,ng,ng)  ! explicit shape, ng is a macro

  print *,'hello bug'
  call someexternal(r3,3)
  print *,r3(3,3,3)
endprogram
__end

$ cat &gt;tse.f90 &lt;&lt; __end
subroutine someexternal(a,b)
   real a(:,:,:)        ! assumed shape
   print *,'b is ',b
   print *,a(1,1,1)
endsubroutine
__end

$ egfortran -c -cpp -Dng=20 t.f90
$ egfortran -c              tse.f90
$ egfortran t.o tse.o
$ ./a.out
 hello bug
 b is    4.20389539E-45

Program received signal SIGSEGV: Segmentation fault - invalid memory reference.
</code></pre>

<p>A compile-time detection for this happens when both program and subroutine
appear in the same file.  In this case, you get</p>

<pre><code> call someexternal(r3,3)
           1
Error: Explicit interface required for 'someexternal' at (1): assumed-shape argument
</code></pre>

<p>To fix this, you can choose to modify the code to be explicit (passing the
dimensions along with the array), or explain the interface to the compiler
with an INTERFACE definition.</p>

<p>The code then looks like this:</p>

<pre><code>program lbugt
  implicit none
  save
  real, allocatable :: r3(:,:,:)  ! deferred shape
  interface
    subroutine someexternal(x,y)
      real, dimension (:,:,:) :: x
      real :: y
    end subroutine
  end interface

  print *,'hello bug'
  allocate (r3(ng,ng,ng))         ! ng is a macro
  call someexternal(r3,3.0)
  print *,r3(3,3,3)
endprogram
</code></pre>

<p>The results look like:</p>

<pre><code>$ egfortran -cpp -Dng=20 -c tb.f90
$ cat lbugp.f90
subroutine someexternal(a,b)
   real a(:,:,:)   ! assumed shape
   print *,'b is ',b
   print *,a(1,1,1)
endsubroutine
$ egfortran -c lbugp.f90
$ egfortran tb.o lbugp.o
$ ./a.out
 hello bug
 b is    3.00000000
   0.00000000
   0.00000000
$
</code></pre>

<h3>Conclusion</h3>

<p>This is one subtlety of the new Fortran language spec: arrays are a little
more complicated that you might think.</p>
