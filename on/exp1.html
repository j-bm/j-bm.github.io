<h1>Experiences with Numerics on OpenBSD - 1 - RNG</h1>

<p>I was porting the CUBE cosmological simulation code and had decided to
start at the beginning.  The Github repo had some demo / test code so
it seemed the best way forward was to walk, not &ldquo;run&rdquo;, ha ha.</p>

<p>RNG means Random Number Generators.</p>

<p>FFT means (fast) Fourier Transform.  The FFTW3 library is one of the popular
and well-tested FFT libraries around.</p>

<p>This experience was a trip through debugging and hypothesizing about fftw3,
compiling, testing, retesting, code-reading and more.</p>

<h2>The fft and OpenMP-FFT testers</h2>

<p>The cube_fft subdirectory had three F90 test programs, for testing FFTs
and OpenMP and combinations.  Well, once you read the code there was
no OpenMP in there.  But the code was doing 3-D FFTs on cubic arrays.</p>

<p>So build (on OpenBSD 6.6, flang 8.0.1, fftw3 3.3.8, g95 8.3.0), using included
build script, and discover g95 conflicts with flang over the location
of mod files.  Move the files, report the bug, and switch to flang (*).</p>

<pre><code>echo $p
-I/usr/local/include -I/usr/local/include/flang -L/usr/local/lib
echo $libf
-lfftw3f

flang -O3 -o testfft.x $p $libf -x f95 test.f90.orig
./testfft.x
...(snip)...
 check results
     NaN             NaN             NaN             NaN
     NaN             NaN             NaN             NaN
     NaN             NaN
</code></pre>

<p>Whoah there.  NaN from an FFT?  Shouldn&rsquo;t anything be allowed as input
and therefore generate valid output?</p>

<p> (*) Note that flang is no longer available on OpenBSD from 6.8 onward.</p>

<h2>GIGO thoughts</h2>

<p>My first thought was gigo, that the input to the FFT was bad, hence the
output was bad.  But how to test?</p>

<pre><code>subroutine checknan(d,ng)
    implicit none
    integer, intent(in) :: ng
    real, intent(in) :: d(:,:,:)

    integer i,j,k
    outer1: do k = 1, ng
    do j = 1, ng
    do i = 1, ng
        if(ieee_is_nan(den(i,j,k))) then
           type *, ' nan at', i, j, k
           exit outer1
        end if
    enddo
    enddo
    enddo outer1
endsubroutine checknan
</code></pre>

<p>And run this before and after the FFT routine.  But no, only the output
had NaN, the input was &ldquo;clean&rdquo;.</p>

<p>So, count the NaNs:</p>

<pre><code>subroutine checknan(d,ng)
    implicit none
    integer, intent(in) :: ng
    real, intent(in) :: d(:,:,:)

    integer i,j,k, nancount
    nancount=0
    outer1: do k = 1, ng
    do j = 1, ng
    do i = 1, ng
        if(ieee_is_nan(den(i,j,k))) then
           nancount = nancount + 1
        end if
    enddo
    enddo
    enddo outer1
    if(nancount &gt; 0) then
        print *,' nans found, ', nancount
    end if
endsubroutine checknan
</code></pre>

<p>And, as it turned out, there were lots:</p>

<pre><code>  nans found,      14047232
</code></pre>

<p>Which was closely related to the array size (306 * 304 * 304),
14047232 being (152 * 304 * 304).</p>

<p>It makes sense.  FFT works by mixing lots of the numbers throughout the
array with lots of arithmetic: a few invalid numbers could spread
throughout the array.</p>

<p>And, sometimes, only 14046624 elements were NaNs.  Huh again!</p>

<h2>Input is only semi-good?</h2>

<p>Reading the various manuals, I rediscovered the IEEE_ builtins, and the IEEE_IS_NORMAL
function which tests for a number that is not denormalized, infinity, or NaN.</p>

<p>But IS_NORMAL always counted 14047232 on the random numbers even when
NaNs numbered 14046624.</p>

<p>Back to the code again.</p>

<h2>Read the code</h2>

<p>There were two processes going on in this test code. Generate some artificial data
using random numbers and an angle and log density function.  Then run
FFT on the artificial data:</p>

<pre><code>integer, parameter :: ng = 304
real den(ng + 2, ng, ng)
....
call random_number(den(:ng, :, :))  !!! fill with random [0,1)
....
    temp_theta = 2*pi*den(i, j, k)
    temp_r = sqrt(-2*log(1 - den(i + 1, j, k)))
    den(i, j, k) = temp_r*cos(temp_theta)
    den(i + 1, j, k) = temp_r*sin(temp_theta)
...
call sfftw_execute(plan_fft) ! forward transform
...
</code></pre>

<p>Which, in words, is a weighted cosine and sine of a random angle.  The
weight includes sqrt( negative * something ).  Which is a hint.  And the
something is log(1 - something).  Another hint.</p>

<p>Both sqrt and log are sensitive to
values outside their valid domain: zero and positive for sqrt, and positive
for log.</p>

<p>The argument to log() is supposed to be positive
since <code>den</code> is filled with
random numbers strictly less than one.  According to the spec of <code>random_number</code>
that is.</p>

<p>So, count more badnesses (and include hexadecimal representation of the
floating point number):</p>

<pre><code>    if(nancount /= notnormalcount) then
    outer3: do k = 1, ng
    do j = 1, ng
    do i = 1, ng
        if((.not. ieee_is_nan   (den(i,j,k))) .and. &amp;
           (.not. ieee_is_normal(den(i,j,k))) ) then
           print '(A,3I5,F16.7,Z12)', ' unnormal ', i,j,k, &amp;
             den(i,j,k), den(i,j,k)
           exit outer3
        end if
    enddo
    enddo
    enddo outer3
</code></pre>

<p>and find this output when checking the sqrt(log()) expression:</p>

<pre><code>unnormal     7  165  111            -Inf    FF800000
</code></pre>

<p>Which confirms the sqrt(log(0)) = negative infinity.  And the expression
above, log(1-den) is in fact the source of the problem!</p>

<p>Now we can check
the random number generator (RNG):</p>

<pre><code>subroutine checkrngone(d,ng)
    implicit none
    integer, intent(in) :: ng
    real, intent(in) :: d(:,:,:)

    integer i,j,k
    outer1: do k = 1, ng
    do j = 1, ng
    do i = 1, ng
        if(den(i,j,k) &gt;= 1.0) then
           print '(A,3I5,F16.7,Z12)', ' snbone ', i,j,k, &amp;
             den(i,j,k), den(i,j,k)
           exit outer1
        end if
    enddo
    enddo
    enddo outer1
</code></pre>

<p>And run this test after filling the array with &ldquo;random numbers less than
one&rdquo;.  And get a hit:</p>

<pre><code>snbone    81   79  104       1.0000000    3F800000
</code></pre>

<p>Aha! But why?  Is there a bug in the runtime?</p>

<p>Read the code for the flang runtime (runtime/flang/random3f.c):</p>

<pre><code>...
extern double drand48();

double ENT3F(RANDOM, random)(void) { return drand48(); }
...
</code></pre>

<p>Which is returning a double (real(8) for those of us who like it that way).</p>

<p>Which means, go back to read the code:</p>

<h2>Truth emerges</h2>

<p>Remember this?</p>

<pre><code>real den(ng + 2, ng, ng)
....
call random_number(den(:ng, :, :))  !!! fill with random [0,1)
</code></pre>

<p>What we were seeing, but didn&rsquo;t understand, was an implied</p>

<pre><code>den = round_to_real4_number(real8_number)
</code></pre>

<p>Any real(8) value slightly less than 1.0D0 was rounded to the real(4)
value 1.0E0.  Which was emphatically <em>not a bug</em>, because it is the standard
way for Fortran conversion from real(8) to real(4).  It&rsquo;s not a bug
in the flang
runtime anyway.  But it is a bug in this test code.  So, to fix:</p>

<pre><code>use ieee_arithmetic, only: ieee_is_nan, ieee_is_normal, &amp;
  ieee_set_rounding_mode, ieee_round_type, ieee_to_zero
...
call ieee_set_rounding_mode(ieee_to_zero)
...
call random_number(den(:ng, :, :))
call checkrngone(den, ng)
...
</code></pre>

<p>And after a few hundred million random numbers are generated and tested,
it seems to work.</p>
