<h1>Experiences with Numerics on OpenBSD - A - Graphical Display</h1>

<p>Based on a draft port of the VTK toolkit posted on ports@, I thought
I would try out displaying various kinds of data from the CUBEnu
simulations.</p>

<p>That turned out to be a bunch of work.</p>

<p>Note &ndash; this posting is of historical curiosity only, because it relies
on integrating Python 3.7 with VTK8.  This is not supported in OpenBSD 6.8,
only OpenBSD 6.7 and some earlier releases.</p>

<h3>VTK - the port</h3>

<p>The Visualization Toolkit (VTK) is a well-established multi-platform
software package used in many HPC, medical, and engineering applications.
See <a href="vtk.org" title="vtk.org">https://vtk.org</a> for more info.</p>

<p>VTK is a library of data processing, rendering and display functions
which are assembled in a C++ or Python program to generate images
on a display.</p>

<p>I was porting vtk8 to a 6.7-current version (precursor to a 6.8 release
of OpenBSD).  In
this case, I wanted to add</p>

<ul>
<li>Python support</li>
<li>integration with the correct OpenGL libraries</li>
<li>compilation, if not delivery in a port, of example programs</li>
</ul>


<p>There were numerous issues getting a port to work.  The result can
be found at <a href="https://marc.info/?l=openbsd-ports&amp;m=160020886226077&amp;w=2" title="Re: [NEW] math/vtk8">Re: [NEW] math/vtk8</a> at marc.info.</p>

<p>The key issue is probably that only Python 3.7 is supported, and this
version of Python is removed from OpenBSD 6.8, so no additional libraries are
available unless you build them yourself.  For this work, only
NumPy is needed and that easily downloads and builds using pip3.</p>

<p>VTK-9 exists and may be a better choice for OpenBSD 6.8 or later, but
for this work I started on the vtk8 release.</p>

<h3>VTK - the use case</h3>

<p>My goal was display of the density field resulting from a CUBEnu
simulation.  As seen in earlier explorations
<a href="exp7.html" title="Python3 Image Display">Python3 Image Display</a>
the static images show considerable structure, but the third
dimension is hard to visualize even in the walk-through movies.</p>

<p>Reading the VTK Textbook over the course of several weeks, I learned
the distinctions and concepts the VTK authors had used and refined
over 20 years of work.  A pipeline of data transformation, geometry
objectification, and rendering is developed for each use-case,
with the VTK library as the central implementation tool.</p>

<p>Climbing this learning curve was necessary, but in the end turned out
to best be understood when I discovered that I need write no software
at all &ndash; an example program had everything needed and had already
been written.</p>

<p>The VTK Cookbook, chapter 7, shows an example with RayCastIsoSurface
program.  This method uses two isosurfaces (defined by a constant
density value in the simulation space), computes triangulated surfaces
of each isosurface, colours them
and displays them.  The result is shown in this figure:</p>

<p><img src="media/testzlog-1.png" title="z=0.000 log density screencap" alt="z=0.000 log density screencap" /></p>

<p>captured with the scrot utility.</p>

<p>The command is</p>

<pre><code>./RayCastIsosurface ../Data/testzlog16.mhd 4800 7600 
</code></pre>

<p>where the mhd file contains</p>

<pre><code>ObjectType = Image
NDims = 3
BinaryData = True
BinaryDataByteOrderMSB = False
CompressedData = False
TransformMatrix = -1 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 -1
Offset = 0 0 0
CenterOfRotation = 0 0 0
AnatomicalOrientation = LAS
ElementSpacing = 0.9375 0.9375 1.5
ITK_InputFilterName = MetaImageIO
DimSize = 544 544 544
ElementType = MET_USHORT
ElementDataFile = testzlog16.bin
</code></pre>

<p>which is basically a file descriptor, and the bin file was
generated from the 3D float file with Python like this:</p>

<pre><code>import numpy as np
ng=544
fnz="path/to/image1/0.000_delta_c_1.bin"
z0=np.memmap(fnz,dtype='float32',mode='r',shape=(ng,ng,ng))
z0lin=np.log(z0-np.min(z0)+1.2)
z0linarr=(z0lin-np.min(z0lin))*16000/(np.max(z0lin)-np.min(z0lin))
z016=z0linarr.astype('uint16')

fnz16=open("Data/testzlog16.bin","wb")
fnz16.write(z016)
fnz16.close()
np.histogram(z016)

(array([143064759,  13616728,   2981478,    848847,    294857,    124833,
       43353,     11891,      2243,       195]),
 array([    0. ,  1599.9,  3199.8,  4799.7,  6399.6,  7999.5,  9599.4,
   11199.3, 12799.2, 14399.1, 15999. ]))
</code></pre>

<p>From this histogram I chose the isosurface values 4800 and 7600.</p>

<h3>Conclusion</h3>

<p>While VTK is complicated and therefore many-featured, it is a steep learning
curve to apply.  There are other tools (Paraview, from the same source).</p>

<p>This display resulted in a number of questions for me:</p>

<ul>
<li>where are the density walls that are described elsewhere? This
display shows only point-like blobs and some tubes.</li>
<li>a logarithmic scaling is required to show the density values</li>
<li>how to speed up the display (rotations are slow; perhaps too much
information in the OpenGL display list?)</li>
<li>can we add a velocity or other field attribute to the colours?</li>
</ul>
