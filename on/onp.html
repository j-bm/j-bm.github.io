<h1>Numerics on OpenBSD - Parallelization</h1>

<h3>Making compiled code work in parallel</h3>

<p>OpenBSD supports symmetric multi-processors, SMP, commonly called multi-core
CPUs.</p>

<p>SMP-enabled programs can run multiple cores simultaneously, generating results
sooner.  Amdahls' Law applies: any parallelized code that relies on
results from non-parallel code is ultimately limited by the speed
of the non-parallel part.</p>

<p>POSIX-compatible threading libraries are included in OpenBSD, if you have
code (like fftw version 3) that can use it.</p>

<p>You can add non-supported OpenMP libraries to your OpenBSD system.  OpenMP
allows you to put simple directives (called pragmas) in your
source C/C++/Fortran code
to run relevant parts in parallel on the multiple cores of your hardware.</p>

<p>Other features such as CUDA or other GPU-related add-on processors are
not available.</p>

<h3>Developing OpenMP code on OpenBSD without OpenMP libraries</h3>

<p>Since the OpenMP runtime is not included in OpenBSD base or via ports, how can
you develop code with the OpenMP pragmas?  The answer is: you need
a &ldquo;stub&rdquo; runtime library that supports OpenMP programs but
behaves as a single-core machine. Also, use the fact that the clang and GNU
compilers support the <code>-fopenmp</code>
switch, even if OpenBSD doesn&rsquo;t include their respective OpenMP runtime libraries.</p>

<p>The stub library was included with the flang compiler (OpenBSD 6.7 and earlier).
But in OpenBSD 6.8 the flang compiler is not available.  So you need your own.</p>

<pre><code>cat &gt; testopenmp.c &lt;&lt; __end
#include &lt;omp.h&gt;
int main(void) {
  return omp_get_num_threads();
}
__end

cc -fopenmp -I/usr/local/include -L/usr/local/lib \
    -I . \
    testopenmp.c myomp.o
./a.out
echo $?
</code></pre>

<p>and see an expected &ldquo;1&rdquo;.  (cc here refers to the default compiler, a.k.a.
clang cc).</p>

<p>For codes that use <code>#pragma omp</code> statements, simply omit the
<code>-fopenmp</code> directive and code that refers to omp_get_xxx() routines
will still work, because the stub supplies them.  The compiler
will ignore <code>#pragma</code> statements it doesn&rsquo;t process.</p>

<p>A stub library needs an <code>omp.h</code> file and an object file to link with.</p>

<p>Here is a simple omp.h file:</p>

<pre><code>#ifndef __OMP_H
#   define __OMP_H

extern void   omp_set_num_threads (int);

extern int    omp_get_num_threads  (void);
extern int    omp_get_max_threads  (void);
extern int    omp_get_thread_num   (void);
extern int    omp_get_num_procs    (void);

#endif /* __OMP_H */
</code></pre>

<p>And here is the corresponding mylib.c stub file:</p>

<pre><code>#include "omp.h"

extern void   omp_set_num_threads (int a) {};

extern int    omp_get_num_threads  (void) {return 1;};
extern int    omp_get_max_threads  (void) {return 1;};
extern int    omp_get_thread_num   (void) {return 0;};
extern int    omp_get_num_procs    (void) {return 1;};
</code></pre>

<p>With this library you can write and partly
debug OpenMP code for use
on other operating systems.</p>

<h3>OpenMP on OpenBSD</h3>

<p>This is not currently supported in &ldquo;base&rdquo; or add-on packages; you will have
to add this yourself.  For clang it&rsquo;s not hard.  For GCC it requires
some time and resources (about 1500MB RAM and 6GB disk in /usr)
to recompile your GCC compiler.  A procedure and patch are
described below.</p>

<p>Note: To do this, you should already be familiar with the OpenBSD ports
system and
making and compiling simple software ports.  This is not for beginners.
Seek help if you need to.</p>

<h4>OpenMP on OpenBSD for Clang compilers</h4>

<p>To setup OpenMP with clang, we will create two new ports: one for the
static runtime library and a second for the dynamic run-time.</p>

<p>First download and extract the ports.tgz file as
described in the
<a href="https://www.openbsd.org/faq/ports/index.html" title="OpenBSD Porter's Handbook">OpenBSD Porter&rsquo;s Handbook</a>.  Use
the file that matches your version of OpenBSD.</p>

<p>Be sure to setup ports building under your own (or a purpose-made account) as
described in the Handbook.  Check that /usr/cache, /usr/distfiles,
/usr/obj and /usr/ports/ have
suitable ownership and permissions.  Test by building the math/minisat
package, which consists of a single download and a few simple compiles.</p>

<p>We show how to build and install packages for both static and dynamic libraries.</p>

<p>For OpenBSD 6.8, fetch <a href="https:openmp1001.tar.gz">this</a> and
<a href="https:stlibomp1001.tar.gz">that</a>.</p>

<p>For OpenBSD 7.1, fetch <a href="https:libomp_obsd71.tgz">this</a> which provides
both static and dynamic libraries.</p>

<p>For OpenBSD 6.8, unpack these two into /usr/ports/mystuff/lang/.</p>

<pre><code>sysctl kern.version
## Verify OpenBSD 6.8
cd /usr/ports/mystuff/
tar xzf path/to/openmp1001.tar.gz
tar xzf path/to/stlibomp1001.tar.gz
</code></pre>

<p>For OpenBSD 6.8, verify the version 10.0.1 within the Makefile is correct then make it:</p>

<pre><code>doas pkg_add ninja cmake xz

cd /usr/ports/mystuff/lang/stlibomp
clang -v    (compare to V= within Makefile)
make package
doas TRUSTED_PKG_PATH=/usr/cache/pub/OpenBSD/6.8/package/amd64/all \
    pkg_add stlibomp

cd /usr/ports/mystuff/lang/libomp
clang -v    (compare to V= within Makefile)
vi Makefile
make package
doas TRUSTED_PKG_PATH=/usr/cache/pub/OpenBSD/6.8/package/amd64/all \
    pkg_add libomp
</code></pre>

<p>For OpenBSD 7.1, the instructions are similar but shorter:</p>

<pre><code>cd /usr/ports/mystuff/
tar xzf path/to/libomp_obsd71.tgz
cd /usr/ports/mystuff/lang/libomp
clang -v    (compare to V= within Makefile)
grep VERSION Makefile
make package
doas TRUSTED_PKG_PATH=/usr/cache/pub/OpenBSD/7.1/package/amd64/all \
    pkg_add libomp
</code></pre>

<p>(If you have problems, check file path, ownerships and o:rew permissions).</p>

<p>Note: There is no support for this configuration.  Do not expect help
from the misc@ or ports@ mailing lists, or from me.</p>

<h4>OpenMP on OpenBSD for GNU Compilers</h4>

<p>For GCC, you can patch the GCC ports files and rebuild GCC to create
new package files for OpenMP.  (The patch adds .h and library
files for OpenMP to the packages).  Use
<a href="https:gcc8_obsd70_gomp.patch" title="patch">this</a> patch file (valid for OpenBSD 7.0)
and
<a href="https:gcc8_obsd71_gomp.patch" title="patch">tother</a> patch file (valid for OpenBSD 7.1):</p>

<pre><code>doas pkg_add xz bison gmake gmp libexecinfo
doas pkg_add libmpc mpfr

cd /usr/ports/lang/gcc/8
patch &lt; path/to/gcc8_obsd70_gomp.patch   # or _obsd71_
env FLAVOR="no_ada" make package
doas TRUSTED_PKG_PATH=/usr/cache/pub/OpenBSD/7.0/package/amd64/all \
    pkg_add -u gcc-libs gcc g95 g++
</code></pre>

<p>This recompiles the four packages gcclibs, gcc, g++, g95, and installs them.</p>

<p>Note: There is no support for this configuration.  Do not expect help
from the misc@ or ports@ mailing lists, or from me.</p>
