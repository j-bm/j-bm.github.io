<h1>Numerics on OpenBSD - Introduction</h1>

<p>This is a short guide to using compilers and
some scripting languages for numerical calculations on OpenBSD.</p>

<p>Not all languages and scripts are included, mostly because I
don&rsquo;t know about all of them.</p>

<p>(This guide is valid for OpenBSD release 6.5 and 6.6 and should be
considered obsolete after October 2020 unless updated.  It is
mostly about the AMD64 and compatible platforms.)</p>

<h2>OpenBSD as a numerical computation platform</h2>

<p>This is not historically one of OpenBSD&rsquo;s reputational strengths.
Mostly it is known for security and excellent documentation.</p>

<p>Yet, many computational tools are available including recent releases:</p>

<ul>
<li>clang compiler, including C, C++ and Flang (Fortran)</li>
<li>GNU C/C++ suite, also including Ada, Fortran, Objective-C</li>
<li>Octave, a workalike to MATLAB</li>
<li>Python including numpy, pandas, scikit-learn, scipy</li>
<li>R, statistical tools</li>
<li>Yorick scientific computing scripting language</li>
<li>Z3 theorem prover (SAT, SMT, etc)</li>
</ul>


<p>It also has libraries such as boost, eigen, fftw, netcdf and others.</p>

<p>Numerical computations are sometime used with OpenBSD
as part of a larger system
such as an embedded computer or, for example, a web service
using machine-learning or
statistical calculations.</p>

<p>Some people use OpenBSD for development of numerical code or for calculating.</p>

<h2>Compiled Languages</h2>

<p>You can find numerical codes in all languages; here we focus on C/C++
using clang and GNU tools.  We also describe a bit of Fortran.</p>

<p>Clang is included in &ldquo;base&rdquo; on AMD64, meaning it comes with the operating system.
GNU languages are added with packages, including C, C++, Fortran and others.</p>

<p>Additional languages such as Forth, Go, Haskell, Ocaml and
Rust are also available for various problems.  These are not covered here.</p>

<h3>Making compiled code go faster</h3>

<p>OpenBSD on the AMD 64-bit platform (which also supports the Intel emulations
known as EMT64) is configured to support all compatible processors including
older ones.  Newer processors have improved instruction sets,
resulting in a variety of options for possibly gaining performance.</p>

<p>By default, the compiler will not optimize for your particular CPU.  As
a result, your code <em>might</em> go faster if you specify some
compiler switches like <code>-Ofast</code> or <code>-O3</code>, or various loop-specific
code-generation options.  Or not: you will have to experiment.</p>

<p>CPU-model specific options are also available.  The easiest way
is <code>-march=native</code>.</p>

<h3>Static linking may improve speed</h3>

<p>Most compiled code automatically produces dynamic-linked executables.  The
executable file thus
includes only the names of shared libraries (located in /usr/lib or
/usr/local/lib).  This reduces disk space use and forces convergence of
library file versions to the same version.  However it may be slower by up to 10%.</p>

<p>Using the <code>--static</code> option in compiler commands, or referencing static
object libraries for most code may help speed.  For example</p>

<pre><code>libset="-I/usr/local/include -L/usr/local/lib"
boostset="-lboost_timer -lboost_chrono -lboost_system"
c++ -o test.x --static $libset $boostset test.cpp
</code></pre>

<p>This results in the essential parts of the three boost libraries (and default
libraries) being
included within
the test.x executable.</p>

<p>See <a href="one.html" title="OpenBSD Numerics - Examples">my examples</a>
page for further information.</p>

<h3>Arithmetic varies with optimization</h3>

<p>AMD64 platforms use 80-bit floating-point
arithmetic internally, and 64-bit arithmetic for
double-precision values that are written
to memory.  Some compile options (vector instructions like SSE3, AVX,
fast-math) may change the conversion of 80-bit numbers or avoid them
altogether.  Numerical results of calcuations with these options may
therefore vary from calculations without these options.</p>

<h3>Speed testing</h3>

<p>Be careful when testing code changes or compiler changes for
effectiveness when searching for faster programs.  Here are some brief
suggestions:</p>

<ol>
<li>Don&rsquo;t believe the first run.  Use the median timing of 5 to 11 runs.</li>
<li>Beware of data caching effects.  If the input data fits in memory then
second and subsequent runs will not perform IO for it.  You can decide
if you care about this.</li>
<li>Be prepared to reproduce older tests &ndash; use software code management tools
and record and label each change including (Makefile) compiler switches.</li>
<li>Don&rsquo;t believe results from a virtual machine.  While it may indicate
approximate speed, remember the VM is shared with other programs and code
and the VM speed will vary from moment to moment.</li>
<li>In my experience <code>-O3</code> is often the best optimization you can do,
within a few percent.
If more is needed, try <code>-march=&lt;cpumodel&gt;</code> especially for later models
of Intel processors.  <code>-march=nosuchmodel</code> gives a list of possibilities.
Also, try <code>-march=native -mcpu=native</code> on GCC compilers.</li>
<li>Beware of optimizations breaking correctness.  Always compare
results as well as elapsed times.</li>
<li>Use well-known external libraries for standard functions
like: array multiplication,
differential equations, root finding, minimization, etc.  These will be
more reliable (accurate, stable) and faster.</li>
<li>You may want to record many facts about your system for each run. This
helps fix problems or reproduce that &ldquo;magic run&rdquo; that is too fast to believe.
Record things like: software versions, disk space, environment variables,
temperatures, date and time, etc.</li>
</ol>


<h3>Mixing clang and GNU languages</h3>

<p>You can use C and Fortran code compiled with either compiler
together in the same executable.  We know this because code compiled
with the GCC C compiler successfully links with the OpenBSD base (built
with clang).</p>

<p>C++ is not compatible across the two because the run-time libraries are
not interchangeable.
If you want to use C++ libraries from ports you have to use clang C++.</p>

<p>If you need to use GNU C++ then you will have to compile any needed C++
libraries with GNU C++ as well.  Examples are: boost, tbb, uuid.
If COMPILER_LIBCXX is in
the ports Makefile for that library, then that library
uses clang C++ and would have to be built separately with GCC (or avoided).</p>

<h2>Scripting Languages</h2>

<p>Most numerically useful interpreted or scripting languages are available.</p>

<p>Python 2.x is available but is deprecated; Python 3.x is available too. A
number of python packages are available to be added as you need them.
Python virtual environments work as well.</p>

<h2>Tools</h2>

<h3>Timing</h3>

<p>Your shell (ksh) has a built-in &ldquo;time&rdquo; command; so does OpenBSD.  Both
report user and system CPU time; <code>/usr/bin/time -l</code>
also reports memory and IO.</p>

<h3>Source Reformatting</h3>

<p>See style(9) for the OpenBSD style guide.</p>

<p>The
<code>clang-format -style="{BasedOnStyle: Mozilla, IndentWidth: 4}"</code>
command generates OpenBSD-like source
from your ragged nasty C/C++ original.  Recommended.  See the manpage.</p>

<p>For Fortran, try <code>fprettify</code> available for Python 3.x.  This program will
change files in-place by default.  See <code>fprettify --help</code>.</p>

<h3>Source Code management</h3>

<p>A software SCM tool provides a reliable way of tracking minor and major code
changes to your software.  You (and your teammates) record change events
with the SCM tool
as you create or test or revise code.  The SCM tracks differences at
each event and
can report on these.  The SCM can also reproduce older versions
of files or sets of files, according to event ids, dates or named
markers.</p>

<p>Use one of: CVS (included with OpenBSD), git (or got), or Subversion.</p>

<p>You can find lots of help online with a web search.</p>

<h3>Testing</h3>

<p>Numerical codes are difficult to test because of design issues
(few or no subroutines or functions), numerical stability questions,
lack of reference solutions for some problems, uncertain approximations
or unknown assumptions.  It&rsquo;s not, however, impossible.  Attention
to accuracy and precision informs the user in addition to the
numerical results.</p>

<blockquote><p>The purpose of computation is insight, not numbers.
 &ndash;Hamming.</p></blockquote>

<p>Test tools come in many shapes; here are some options:</p>

<ol>
<li>Coverage testing: using chosen input data the tool generates a report
identifying which code segments were exercised, or not, by the test data.
Unexercised code needs closer review, or further testing.</li>
<li>Function testing: routines and functions can be exercised with
selected parameters and results checked.  This focuses testing on
individual routines.</li>
<li>Static code examination: these tools report on lines of source code
with problematic syntax such as &lsquo;==&rsquo; and &lsquo;=&rsquo; confusion; misspelled
variables; unreachable code, and so on.</li>
</ol>


<p>Automated testing has additional benefits: it helps protect against
bugs introduced by code changes (or compiler or operating system
updates); it documents the tests for subsequent review; it
serves as an educational tool for new programmers learning a
large code base.</p>
